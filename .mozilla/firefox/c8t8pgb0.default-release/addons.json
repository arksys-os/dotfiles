This project inherits from legacy Firefox add-on ScrapBook X.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Capture faithfully: A web page shown in the browser can be captured without losing any subtle detail. Metadata such as source URL and timestamp are also recorded.\n2. Customizable capture: WebScrapBook can save selected area in a page, save source page (before processed by scripts), or save page as a bookmark. How to capture images, audio, video, fonts, frames, styles, scripts, etc. are also customizable. A web page can be saved as a folder, a ZIP-based archive file (HTZ or MAFF), or a single HTML file.\n3. Page editing: A web page can be highlighted, annotated, or edited before or after a capture.\n4. Organizable collections: Captured pages can be organized in the browser sidebar using one or more scrapbooks, and each scrapbooks holds a hierarchical tree structure to organize data items. Notes using HTML or markdown format can also be created and managed. (*)\n5. Fulltext searching: Each scrapbook can be further indexed for a rich-feature search (using title, fulltext, comment, source URL, create time, modify time, etc.). (*)\n6. Remote access: Captured data can be hosted with a central backend server and be read or edited from other devices. Alternatively, a scrapbook can generate a static site index and be distributed as a static web site. (*)\n7. Mobile support: WebScrapBook supports mobile browsers such as Firefox for Android and Kiwi browser. You can capture and edit the web page from a mobile phone or tablet.\n8. Legacy ScrapBook support: Scrapbooks created from legacy ScrapBook or ScrapBook X can be converted into WebScrapBook-compliant format for usage. (*)\n* All or partial functionality of a starred feature above requires a running collaborating backend server, which can be easily set up using PyWebScrapBook.\n* An HTZ or MAFF archive file can be viewed using the built-in archive page viewer, using PyWebScrapBook or other assistant tools, or by opening the index page after unzipping.\n\nSee Also:\n* For further information and frequently asked questions, visit the documentation wiki.\n* For better discussion, please report an issue to the source repository.","weeklyDownloads":163,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Danny Lin","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/6069572/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/247/247555.png?modified=1622132805","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/247/247555.jpg?modified=1622132805","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Capture web pages with WebScrapBook."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/247/247556.png?modified=1622132807","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/247/247556.jpg?modified=1622132807","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"WebScrapBook is highly customizable.
